                <h3>Philanthropy at Carleton takes many forms, and faculty and staff play a vital role in fostering a culture of giving on campus. Professors Janine Debanné and Yvan Labiche are among those making a difference—not just as educators, but as dedicated donors committed to supporting student success. <br><br>

                    Debanné, an Associate Professor at the Azrieli School of Architecture, and Labiche, Chair of the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, both joined Carleton in January 2001. Their journey together began on campus, where they met in the then faculty club in 2003 and later married in 2006. Over the years, their commitment to Carleton has extended beyond the classroom, embracing philanthropy as a shared value.<br><br>
                    
                    Debanné has been a monthly donor through payroll deduction since 2005, and Labiche followed in 2011. Their contributions have become a meaningful way to create change and directly impact students’ lives. Each was inspired to give in their own way. <br><br>
                    
                    “Carleton gave me so much – my undergraduate degree and the chance to work in a profession I loved, and later, an interesting and enriching teaching career. So, there were lots of reasons to give back,” says Debanné.</h3>

                    Through his channel, Alpine Builds, Holmes has built a global following teaching realistic city design using Minecraft — inspiring future architects and engineers one block at a time.<br><br>
                    
                    Holmes credits Carleton for giving him the tools to turn a childhood curiosity into a thriving creative career. The university’s distinctive engineering program — and the opportunities it offered — gave him the knowledge, experience and confidence to transform his interest in building virtual cities into real-world impact.</h3>

                <h3>A type of woody tree or shrub that grows along tropical or subtropical coastlines, they have evolved to thrive in salty, low-oxygen terrain.<br><br>

                    Thanks to this resilience, mangroves help protect shorelines from waves and storm surges, reducing the risk of flooding. Their dense root networks bind soil in place, mitigating the impact of erosion and rising seas. They also improve water quality through filtration, support biodiversity by providing habitat for animals and other plants and sequester significantly more carbon than mature tropical forests.<br><br>
                    
                    Planting mangrove seeds to boost this natural defence system is a labour-intensive process, but Carleton University student Stefan Teodorescu has come up with a creative, high-tech and very impressive solution.</h3>

                <h3>The construction industry is notoriously resistant to change. Projects can be extremely complex, with architects, engineers, builders and subcontractors guided by different, sometimes competing priorities. They’re also typically risk-averse — or, to be blunt, set in their ways.<br><br>

                    New modes of collaboration and new technologies are the key to modernizing how we build. This is an urgent need in Canada, considering the country’s severe housing shortage, the importance of adopting more sustainable processes and materials, and an impending wave of retirements that will see about 20 per cent of the sector’s workforce hang up their hammers by the end of the decade.<br><br>
